xk6-browser v0.3.0 is here! :tada:


## New features



## Bugs fixed

- Make concealed elements clickable. ([#264](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/264))

  Previously, interacting with an element obscured by another was failing with `wait for selector did not result in any nodes`. Now we properly detect this scenario and retry the action with different scroll positions. This affects all `Element` and `Frame` `click()`, `dblclick()`, `hover()`, `check()`, `uncheck()` and `tap()` actions.
