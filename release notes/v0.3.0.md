xk6-browser v0.3.0 is here! :tada:


## New features



## Bugs fixed

- Immediately return when an element is not clickable. ([#264](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/264))

  xk6-browser was resulting in _"wait for selector did not result in any nodes" error when clicked on an element that was obscured by another element. Now it detects whether the element is behind an element, hence not clickable, and returns an error instead without waiting.

  Affected actions by this fix:
  * ElementHandle.Click
  * ElementHandle.Dblclick
  * ElementHandle.Hover
  * ElementHandle.SetChecked
  * ElementHandle.Tap
  * Frame.Click
  * Frame.Dblclick
  * Frame.Hover
  * Frame.Check
  * Frame.Tap
  * Frame.Uncheck
