xk6-browser v0.7.0 is here! :tada:

We've been busy preparing for big changes in the future, so this minor release is smaller than usual. It contains a new feature to unblock users using `dialog` boxes, and internal improvements.


## Bugs fixed

- `xk6-browser` no longer panics when it navigates to a website that contains `iframes` which themselves navigate to a different origin to the main `frame` (e.g. a website containing an embedded Youtube video). ([#677](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/677))


## New features

- `xk6-browser` will now automatically dismiss dialog boxes (`alert`, `confirm`, `prompt`, and `beforeunload`). ([#663](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/663))


## Improvements

- Improved launching of a browser without providing any options. ([#649](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/649))
 
  We couldn't launch a new browser without providing an empty object. We've fixed this, so now you can launch a new browser without an empty object.
    
    With the empty object:

    ```js
    const browser = chromium.launch({});
    ```

    Without the empty object:

    ```js
    const browser = chromium.launch();
    ```


### Documentation

- Updated the demo video on our README. ([#639](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/639))

  Now it shows the usage for xk6-browser version v0.6.0 and above.

- Simplified the README. ([#656](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/656))

  You can now find the documentation [here](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/xk6-browser/).

- Updated the project roadmap. ([#658](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/658))


## Internals

- Upgraded `k6` dependency to `v0.42.0`. ([#?](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/?))

- Refactored the lifecycle events code. ([#647](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/647), [#644](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/644))
	
    This shouldn't change any existing behavior, but if you notice anything that doesn't work as expected, please let us know. 

- Fix for CI. ([#674](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/674))

### Experimental Module Merge into k6

- `xk6-browser` is now importable as an experimental module from `k6`. ([#667](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/667))

- Disabling of `xk6-browser` in restricted environments. ([#665](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/665))

- Fixed `k6` network `Hosts` incompatibility. ([#671](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/671))
