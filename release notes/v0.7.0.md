xk6-browser v0.7.0 is here! :tada:

We've been busy preparing for big changes in the future, so this minor release is smaller than usual. It contains a new feature to unblock users using `dialog` boxes, and internal improvements.


## New features

- `xk6-browser` will now automatically dismiss dialog boxes (`alert`, `confirm`, `prompt`, and `beforeunload`). ([#663](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/663))


## Improvements

- Updated the video to match what we released in `v0.6.0`, and it's still relevant for `v0.7.0`. ([#639](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/639))
- We couldn't launch a new browser without providing at least an empty object. We've fixed this so now you can launch a new browser without that empty object. ([#649](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/649))
    
    With the empty object:

    ```js
    const browser = chromium.launch({});
    ```

    Without the empty object:

    ```js
    const browser = chromium.launch();
    ```

- Made improvements to the code that handles lifecycle events. This shouldn't change any of the existing behavior, but if you notice anything that doesn't work as you expected please let us know. ([#647](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/647), [#644](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/644))

- Simplified the README. You will now be redirected to the [documentation](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/xk6-browser/). ([#656](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/656))

- The project roadmap has been updated. ([#658](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/658))

- Some more internal changes that are worth talking about, which is that we're making it simpler to import so that we can make this extension an experimental module in `k6`. ([#667](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/667), [#665](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/665))



## Internals

- Upgraded `k6` dependency to `v0.42.0`. ([#?](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/?))

- Several refactors and bug fixes to improve maintainability and stability. ([#671](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/671), [#674](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/674))
