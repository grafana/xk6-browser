**xk6-browser** is a [k6](https://k6.io/) extension that supports browser automation through the [Chrome Devtools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) (CDP). It adds browser-level APIs to interact with browsers and collect frontend performance metrics as part of your k6 tests.

**As of [k6 version 0.43.0](https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v0.43.0), xk6-browser is now bundled in k6 as an experimental module, and usable without a separate binary or compilation step!**

Special acknowledgment to the authors of [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) for their trailblazing work in this area. This project is heavily influenced and in some regards based on the code of those projects.

## Goals

- Bring browser automation to the k6 testing platform while supporting core k6 features like VU executors, scenarios, metrics, checks, thresholds, logging, DNS remapping, IP blocklists, etc.
- Test stability as the top priority by supporting non-flaky [selectors](https://playwright.dev/docs/selectors) combined with [auto-waiting](https://playwright.dev/docs/actionability/) for actions just like Playwright.
- Aim for rough API compatibility with [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright). The reason for this is two-fold; for one we don't want users to have to learn a completely new API just to use xk6-browser, and secondly, it opens up for using the [Playwright RPC server](https://github.com/mxschmitt/playwright-go) as an optional backend for xk6-browser should we decide to support that in the future.
- Support for Chromium compatible browsers first, and eventually Firefox and WebKit-based browsers.

See our [project roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for more details.
